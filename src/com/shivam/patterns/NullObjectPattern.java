 * Null Object Pattern
 * 
 * Null object pattern 
 * 
 * Problem with null is that if something is nullable, then it either has a value or doesn't have a value ie is null.
 * This introduces additional branching in the code in the sense that if something has a value then it follows one path and if it
 * doesn't have a value then it follows another path. It results in extra branching, extra checks needed for null.
 * 
 * Whenever we see a null, there's a high likelyhood that we could replace it with a Nullable Object.
